The Position query returns data for the requested coordinate, logic for identifying the best match for the coordinate will depend on the Collection and the filter constraints are defined by the following query parameters:

===== *Parameter coords*

include::../REQ_rc-coords-definition.adoc[]

include::../REQ_rc-coords-response.adoc[]

location(s) to return data for, the coordinates are defined by a Well Known Text
(wkt) string. to retrieve a single location :

`POINT(x y)` 

And for a list of locations

`MULTIPOINT\((x y),(x1 y1),(x2 y2),(x3 y3))`

And for a list of locations at defined heights

`MULTIPOINT\((x y),(x1 y1),(x2 y2),(x3 y3))`

see http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=25355 and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry

the coordinate values will depend on the CRS parameter, if this is not defined
the values will be assumed to WGS84 values (i.e x=longitude and y=latitude)

.Single location
=================
retrieve data for Greenwich, London

`coords=POINT(0 51.48)`
=================


.Multiple locations
=================
retrieve data for a list of locations : 38.9N 77W, 48.85N 2.35E, 39.92N 116.38E, 35.29S 149.1E, 51.5N 0.1W  

`coords=MULTIPOINT\((38.9 -77),(48.85 2.35),(39.92 116.38),(-35.29 149.1),(51.5 -0.1))`
=================

===== *Parameter z*

include::../REQ_rc-z-definition.adoc[]

include::../REQ_rc-z-definition.adoc[]

Define the vertical level to return data from 
i.e. z=level

if data at all available levels is required z can be defined as ALL
i.e. z=ALL

.A single vertical level
===========

for instance if the 850hPa pressure level is being queried

z=850
===========

.Return data at all a levels defined by a list of vertical levels
===========

Request data at levels 1000hPa, 900hPa, 850hPa, and 700hPa

z=1000,900,850,700
===========

.Return data for all levels between and including 2 defined levels
===========

Request data for all levels between 2m and 100m

z=2/100
===========

.Return data at all available vertical levels
===========

z=ALL
===========

`When not specified the API MUST return data from all available levels`
